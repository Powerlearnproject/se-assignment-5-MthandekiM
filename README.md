Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.

   Prerequisites:
      A Windows 11 operating system.
      Internet connection.
      Administrator privileges to install software.

   Steps to Download and Install Visual Studio Code:
      Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Edge, Chrome, Firefox).
   
   Navigate to the Visual Studio Code Website:
      Go to the official Visual Studio Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   
   Download the Installer:
      On the homepage, you’ll see a button to download for Windows. Click on the "Download for Windows" button. This will start downloading the VS Code installer (VSCodeSetup.exe).
   
   Run the Installer:
      Once the download is complete, navigate to the location where the installer was downloaded (usually the Downloads folder).
      Double-click on the VSCodeSetup.exe file to run the installer.
   
   Start the Installation Process:
       User Account Control (UAC) prompt may appear asking for permission to allow the installer to make changes to your device. Click "Yes" to continue.
      The Visual Studio Code Setup Wizard will open. Click "Next" to start the installation process.
   
   Accept the License Agreement:
      Read through the license agreement, then check the box to accept the agreement and click "Next".
   
   Choose Installation Location:
      Choose the destination folder where you want to install VS Code. The default location is usually fine, so you can click "Next" to continue.
   
   Select Additional Tasks:
      You will be prompted to select additional tasks you’d like to perform during the installation. It’s recommended to:
         Create a desktop icon.
         Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file context menu.
         Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer directory context menu.
         Register Code as an editor for supported file types.
         Add to PATH (this allows you to open VS Code from the command line).
      Check the boxes for these tasks as needed and click "Next".

   Install VS Code:
      Click "Install" to begin the installation process. The installer will copy files and set up VS Code on your system.
   
   Complete the Installation:
      Once the installation is complete, you will see the final setup screen. You can check the box to launch Visual Studio Code immediately.
      Click "Finish" to exit the installer.
   
   Launch Visual Studio Code:
      If you didn’t check the box to launch VS Code immediately, you can open it later by double-clicking the Visual Studio Code icon on your desktop or by searching for "Visual Studio Code" in the Start menu.
